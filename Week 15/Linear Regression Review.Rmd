As we go through linear regression on previous course;  
today we tried one more problem sets to ensure our comprehension of linear regression.  


# Problem 1
Use `tips` dataset (https://www.openintro.org/stat/data.php?data=tips)  
to detect whther there's association between `number of people in group` and `total tips`.

1. Do the plots to see whther there's linearity relationship.
2. See the correlation of the two variables.
3. Conduct linear square regression and find the `intercept` and `slope`.
4. Do the data provide strong evidence that more people in group is associated with more tips¡H
5. Do residual plots.
6. Plot the regression line and real data point scatterplot together.
7. How much would they pay the tip if there are 12 people in the group¡H
